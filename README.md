- **Scroll Trigger Animations**: The webpage includes scroll-triggered animations, adding an extra layer of interactivity by animating elements as the user scrolls through the page.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The webpage is built using React, providing a fast and modular framework for development.
  
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, offering a utility-first approach that allows for rapid and custom design implementations.
